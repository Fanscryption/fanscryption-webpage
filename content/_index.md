## About us

Welcome to the Fanscryption Community Hub—your unofficial home for Inscryption fan projects and artwork!

Founded in early 2022 by LeshyIRL, we started as a small group of artists who wanted to make the popular indie video
game Inscryption in real life and recreate the magic that captured us in our initial playthroughs. Over time, our
community has grown extensively, featuring everything from custom cards and fan art to mods, PvP, and more!

Our mission is to be the central hub for all fan projects, embracing creativity big and small. We've collaborated with
the wider Daniel Mullins Games community frequently—hosting community livestreams and even working with Daniel Mullins
himself to raise money for charity!

This website is a work in progress, and we're committed to expanding in the coming months to showcase even more
incredible community creations. Our goal is to maintain this website as a permanent repository of the Inscryption
fandom’s amazing talents, and we are committed to featuring even more of the community’s work in subsequent updates!

Want to contribute? Fill out the form below, or reach out to LeshyIRL via Discord if you have a really unique project.
Enjoy the gallery, and stay tuned as we continue celebrating the vast creativity of the Inscryption fandom!
